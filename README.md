This project covers essential concepts of the Flask Python framework. It shows how to make a small web application, run it in a development server, and allow the user to provide custom data via URL parameters and web forms. Jinja template engine is also used to reuse HTML files and use logic in them. At the end, once the application has been deployed, you now have a fully functioning web blog that interacts with an SQLite database to create, display, edit, and delete blog posts using the Python language and SQL queries.
